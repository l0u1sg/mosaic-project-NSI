# Mosaic Project
## Introduction
Here is one of the projects we have to do in NSI (Numerical Computer Science), the Mosaic Project. The goal of this project is to create a program that will generate a mosaic of a given image. This program is written in Python and this is the structure of its files :
- The main file is called main.py. It contains the main code of the program.
- The images folder contains the images that will be used in the mosaic.
- The functions.py file contains the functions that will be used in the program.

## How to create a mosaic
1. Import your reference image into the current folder. 
No need to import the thumbnails, they are already in 20x20 format. A function will be added soon to put custom thumbnails that will be automatically cropped

2. Open the main.py file and replace the values with your image values

3. Run the program.
Depending on the size of the image (which is automatically doubled), the processing time may be long.
